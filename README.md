Soundtracks and D2 Maximum mod for DXX-Rebirth and DXX-Retro

The DXX-Rebirth and DXX-Retro installers use a dropbox url that is no longer valid.
I made this project to host these files so they're not and/or have to dig around to find them...

Due to file size restrictions on github, I used 7zip to store files greater than 50M and split them at 47M. While the true limit is 100M, I felt aiming for the 50M warning would be better than getting close to the hard limit.
Sorry about splitting the files but I rather have it like this than having the lost to time!


In the future, I probably fork the DXX-Rebirth/Retro installers to use this project and handle the file splits and/or look into git-lfs... Until them, please manually extract the files and move that soundtrack/mod to the proper D1X or D2X directory.


Files that are 7zip splitted:
d1cda-mac.dxa
d1-finn.dxa
d1midi-awe32.dxa
d1midi-ensoniq2m.dxa
d1midi-ensoniq8m.dxa
d1midi-rolandsc.dxa
d1-playstation.dxa
d1xr-opl3-music.dxa
d1xr-sc55-music.dxa
d2cda-mac.dxa
d2cda-max.xda
d2cda-tdc.xda
